				It is believed that coffee was first discovered in Ethiopia in the 9th century,
				and it quickly spread throughout the Middle East and Europe.
				Coffee beans are actually the seeds of a coffee plant, which are roasted and ground to create the beverage we know and love today.
				There are many different types of coffee, and each has its own unique flavor and aroma.Espresso is one of the most popular types of coffee,
				and it is made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans.This creates a strong and intense flavor, and it is often served with steamed milk or cream. 
				 Brewed coffee is another popular type, and it is made by pouring hot water over ground coffee beans. This creates a milder flavor, and it is often served with cream and sugar.
